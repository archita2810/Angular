# Angular
# Installation pre-requisites

# Installing the Angular CLI
With the following command the angular-cli will be installed globally in your machine:

_**npm install -g @angular/cli**

# To Run the Development Backend Server
In order to be able to provide realistic examples, we will need in our playground a small REST API backend server. We can start the sample application backend with the following command:

**npm run server**_
_
This is a small Node REST API server.


# To run the Development UI Server
To run the frontend part of our code, we will use the Angular CLI:

**npm start**_
_
The application is visible at port 4200: http://localhost:4200
